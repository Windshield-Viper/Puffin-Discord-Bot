# Puffin Discord Bot
The rise in social media users in recent years has made community content moderation difficult. Here's my attempt at changing that, with an open-source Discord bot that aims to help moderators keep their communities safer.

Puffin is an auto-moderation Discord bot utilizing sentiment analysis and zero-shot learning. Feel free to reach out with pull requests, feature requests, bug reports, or any other comments/issues you may have.
